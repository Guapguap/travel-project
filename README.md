Concept:
As an avid outdoor person, I wanted to go to a website that gives me high level park information when I select a park that I wanted to checkout.
<br>
<br>
Roles:
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

#Version 2.0 Might Include:
<br>
<br>
The addition of photos to the corresponding parks in the park list would be an enhancement. Style updates might be to add a background image and animation to the State drop down list. Google Maps could be expanded to include additional pins.
<br>
<br>
#General Functionality:
<br>
<br>
The user is initially presented with a drop down to select a US State. Upon selecting "Submit" the transition presents a list of State specific National Parks
from which the user would make a selection. The result would present the user with a Google Map, Park specific photo carousel, historical details about the
selected park and a list of interesting activities available at the park. There is also entry cost details and a National Park Directory link for travel help.
Additionaly, the "Weather Forecast" button becomes available. When the "Weather Forecast" button is selected the user is presented with a 5 days forecast of
the specific park. The "Weather Forecast" button will close the 5 day forecast window. At the top of the screen there is a "Select State" button which will
bring the user back to a screen that allows the user to select a different state and collection of parks. To the right of the screen a list of each park
explored is saved for reference. The "Clear Recent Parks" button will clear this list from the screen.
