Concept:
As an avid outdoor person, I wanted to go to a website that gives me high level park information when I select a park that I wanted to checkout.
<br>
<br>
Roles:
<br>
<br>
Alberto: Worked on the JavaScript. Focused on the functionality of the Park selection, park display of information (park buttons, carousel, activites), local storage
<br>
Mason: Worked on the JavaScript. Focused on the functionality of the maps, weather, park display of information (about and description), local storage.
<br>
Timothy: Worked on the CSS and HTML. Focused on the styling and layout of the website to be engaging and user intuitive.
<br>
Arthur: Worked on the ReadMe, PowerPoint, and Software Testing. Focused on fleshing out the bugs and errors of the current main branch.

#Version 2.0 Might Include:
<br>
<br>
The addition of photos to the corresponding parks in the park list would be an enhancement. Style updates might be to add a background image and animation to the State drop down list. Google Maps could be expanded to include additional pins.
<br>
<br>
#General Functionality:
<br>
<br>
The user is initially presented with a drop down to select a US State. Upon selecting "Submit" the transition presents a list of State specific National Parks
from which the user would make a selection. The result would present the user with a Google Map, Park specific photo carousel, historical details about the
selected park and a list of interesting activities available at the park. There is also entry cost details and a National Park Directory link for travel help.
Additionally, the "Weather Forecast" button becomes available. When the "Weather Forecast" button is selected the user is presented with a 5 days forecast of
the specific park. The "Weather Forecast" button will close the 5 day forecast window. At the top of the screen there is a "Select State" button which will
bring the user back to a screen that allows the user to select a different state and collection of parks. To the right of the screen a list of each park
explored is saved for reference. The "Clear Recent Parks" button will clear this list from the screen.

# Challenges

<br>

- Connecting the NPS api to our google maps and openweather apis
- Time management- deciding which features/issues should be prioritized
- LocalStorage- using multiple values per object was a challenge
- Page display-Swapping between different pages meant having to show/hide different elements
